					<h1>The Last Supper Club</h1>
					<h2>Your personalised dining experience.</h2>
					<h3 class="bot-marg-1">4th - 12th July</h3>
					<p>We believe that great food with your best friends should be fuss free. That's why we've created an evening where you pick the menu, without the hassle of preparing, serving or clearing up afterwards. A home cooked meal where none of you have to host.</p>
					<p>Pick two courses, a couple of companions and bring your own beverage. We sort out the rest, along with a few edible extras, for a set price of Â£24 per head.</p>

			<section class="body-section">
				<h3>The cook</h3>
				<p>Mr B. spent his childhood cooking dinner parties for his parents. When he grew up, he went on a ski season to refine his skills serving delicious food in a fine wooden chalet. Despite his love for food (and mountains), he  ended up back in the UK working as a designer. While he built websites, he continued to cook and eat plenty of food, but it was never as rewarding as when he was serving it to others. So he started The Last Supper Club. The rest, he hopes, will soon be history.</p>
