			<h3>The cook</h3>
			<p>Mr B. spent his childhood cooking dinner parties for his parents. After a brief spell eating lots of cereal as a student, he eventually went on a ski season to refine the art of serving a delcious meal in a fancy catered chalet. Despite his love for food and the mountains, he soon ended up back in the UK working as a designer. His love of cooking lay dormant beneath the surface...but it couldn't stay dormant forever!</p>
